## Overview

**mighf** is a minimal, educational micro-architecture and emulator project.  
It lets you experiment with a simple CPU, custom instruction set, and assembly-like programming—all in software.

## Features

- Simple 8-register, 1KB memory micro-architecture
- Assembler and Runtime made in pure `C`
- In-terminal drawing with ASCII graphics
- Interactive shell for loading and running programs
- Easily extensible instruction set

## Getting Started

### Build

```sh
g++ source/mighf-unix-msys.c -o mighf.bin
```

### Run

```sh
./mighf.bin
```

### Example

Load and run an assembly program:

```sh
coreshell> load rom/rom.s
coreshell> run
```

## Assembly Example

```asm
TDRAW_CLEAR
MOV R1, 10
MOV R2, 5
TDRAW_PIXEL R1, R2, '*'
```

## Project Structure

- `source/` — Runtime and assembler source code
- `rom/` — MicroComputing ROM (also the Mini BIOS)
- `README.md` — This file
